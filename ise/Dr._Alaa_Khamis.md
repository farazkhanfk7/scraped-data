Alaa Khamis, PhD, SMIEEE

AI & Smart Moiblity Professor and Director of AI for Smart Mobility Lab
Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering and IRC for Smart Mobility and Logistics
College of Computing and Mathematics at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals
Adjunct Faculty at University of Toronto and Ontario Tech University
Former AI & Smart Mobility Technical Leader at General Motors

Research
November 25, 2024
I lead the AI for Smart Mobility (AI4SM) Lab at KFUPM. Our mission at AI4SM is to advance transformative innovations that prioritize user experience, enhance connectivity, and drive sustainable electrification. By integrating cutting-edge research with interdisciplinary collaboration, we aim to create mobility solutions that empower individuals, foster global connectivity, and contribute to a cleaner, smarter, and more inclusive world.

My current research focuses on the intersection of AI with mobility systems, services, and business models. My research addresses a wide range of problems, including seamless integrated mobility, SDV observability, combining reasoning and action, contextual causal inference, and design, planning, and control problems related to people mobility, logistics, and transportation infrastructure.
In my previous role as AI & Smart Technical Leader at General Motors, I led AI/ML projects focused on software-defined vehicles, connected and automated driving technologies, active safety systems, and prognostics, achieving successful technology insertions. He co-invented and filed 72 patents, trade secrets, and defensive publications, earning recognition as “Inventor of the Month” multiple times by GM's Global Patent & Invention Management team. The advanced features developed were for future GM vehicle models; therefore, further details cannot be disclosed due to confidentiality agreements with GM. Additional information about the filed patents can be found here.

Before joining GM, I worked as a Senior Research Scientist at Vestec, Inc., where I applied intelligent data analysis techniques in speech signal processing and recognition systems. I co-invented and filed several US patents about speaker adaptation, noise type identification, SNR estimation and smart speech enhancement.

I founded and coordinated the GUC Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) research group. GUC RAS undertakes inter-disciplinary research in areas like intelligent automated systems, industrial automation, industrial robotics and mobile robotics.

I wrote a proposal for the establishment of University of Waterloo Center of Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (CPAMI). CPAMI started officially on March 1, 2011 and I currently serve as an affiliated member of this center. I coordinated several focus groups in CPAMI such as Robotics and Autonomous Systems, Autonomous Systems and Real Time Distributed Design, Machine Perception and Sensors, Smart Mobility and domain adaptation group.

I wrote a number of winning research grant proposals for Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC Strategic Project Grant, NSERC Research Tools and Instruments and NSERC–Collaborative Research and Development Grant), Public Security Technical Program (PSTP), Microsoft, Public Works and Government Services Canada (PW&GSC), European Commission and Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) for Canada Revenue Agency (total obtained funding is $2,681,636)

Teaching
November 25, 2024

I strongly believe that one of the most important tasks for a teacher is inspire students' interest in the subject and try to motivate them to participate and to play an active role in the learning process. Not all of us teach, but everyone, at one time or another, learns. Learning is the common ground I share with my students. As a teacher, I am constantly learning about learning, striving to identify the diverse needs of my students, and inventing new strategies of instruction in response to students' requirements.

Immediate opening for a Postdoc at University of Waterloo in the area of multimodal data fusion and robotics.
The Partners of the NSERC CRD project "Discrimination of Critical Objects and Events in Pervasive Multimodal Surveillance Systems" invite motivated PhD holders, in the fields of multimodal data fusion, sequential decision making under uncertainty and robotics, to apply for Postdoctral Fellowships.
This project addresses the problem of the maximizing discrimination power in critical surveillance operations using a pervasive multi-modal system. A closed-loop approach that combines adaptive data fusion and sensor management will be used.
Successful candidates must hold a Ph.D.in an engineering discipline related to multimodal data fusion, sensor management, target tracking or sequential decision making under uncertainty, have a strong interest in robotics and multiagent research, and have a good level in both written and spoken English.
All applications should include a cover letter indicating the motivation and research interests of the candidate, a CV including a list of publications, proof of academic qualifications and should provide the names and contact details of two referees. Send materials by email to Dr. Alaa Khamis. [posted January 12, 2010]
