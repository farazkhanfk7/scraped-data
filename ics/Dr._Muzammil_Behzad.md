Dr. Muzammil Behzad is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS) at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM), Saudi Arabia, since August 2024. Before this, he worked as an AI Scientist at Silo AI, Finland, and as a researcher at the Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis at the University of Oulu, Finland, where he also earned his PhD (with distinction) in 2022. Dr. Muzammil is recognized as an expert in artificial intelligence and computer vision, with a strong focus on affective computing, human-computer interaction, and recently, generative AI. His research interests are advancing developments in:
machine learning, deep learning and computer vision
affective computing
generative AI and vision-language models
object detection and segmentation
3D computer vision
image restoration and enhancement
classical signal, image and video processing
Dr. Muzammil actively contributes to several prestigious professional organizations, including the European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI), the Finnish Artificial Intelligence Society (FAIS), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA), and the European Alliance for Innovation (EAI). Dr. Muzammil is actively seeking industrial and academic partners for collaboration opportunities focused on developing more intelligent, robust, and sustainable artificial intelligence applications. Additionally, he is looking for motivated graduate students (MS/PhD) and postdoctoral researchers to join his team.

# Personal Website

I am an AI Scientist at Silo AI (Finland), and a researcher at the Center for Machine Vision and Signal Analysis in the University of Oulu (Finland), where I also completed my PhD (with distinction) in 2022 with Academy Professor Guoying Zhao. Prior to that, I received my partially-funded B.S. degree (with distinctions - double medalist and valedictorian) and fully-funded M.S. degree, both in Electrical Engineering, from COMSATS University Islamabad (Pakistan) and King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (Saudi Arabia), in 2013 and 2017, respectively. I worked as a visiting research scholar in the University College London (UK), Brown University (USA), and King Abdullah University of Science & Technology (Saudi Arabia). I have also held full-time academic positions in Pukyong National University (South Korea), and COMSATS University Islamabad (Pakistan). My research interests lie in signal and image processing, embedded systems, machine/deep learning and computer vision.
