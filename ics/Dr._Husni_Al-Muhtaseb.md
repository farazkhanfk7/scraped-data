 Teaching

ICS 545 Arabic Computing for Graduate Students (081)

Arabic Computing course examines a range of issues concerning computer concepts related to Arabic. Among the issues to be discussed are: Arabic Language Characteristics, Arabic Character Sets, Standardization, Unicode, Arabization systems, Arabic software tools, Arabic programming languages and Introduction to Arabic Computations.

ICS 484 Arabic Computing (Arabization of Computers)

Arabic Computing (Arabization of Computers) course examines a range of issues concerning computer concepts related to Arabic. Among the issues to be discussed are: Arabic Language Characteristics, Arabic Character Sets, Standardization, Unicode, Arabization systems, Arabic software tools, Arabic programming languages and Introduction to Arabic Computations.

This course is being offered at KFUPM since 1994. We believe that we are the first institute in the world who offered this course at that time. Now tens of universities and colleges are offering it. Here, we are providing course material and samples of course requirements for the public. Please feel free to use the material and contact me for suggestions and enhancements.

ICS 482 Natural Language Processing

This course examines a range of issues concerning computer systems that can process human languages. Among the issues to be discussed are morphological and syntactic processing, semantic interpretation, discourse processing and knowledge representation.

ICS 350/ 351/ 352 Cooperative Work

A continuous period of 28 weeks spent as a normal employee in industry, business, or government agencies with the purpose of familiarizing students with the real world of work and enabling them to integrate their classroom learning to a real work environment. During this period, a student is exposed to a real-life work in the field.


Research

Research Interests include: Computer Arabization, Arabic Computing, English-Arabic Machine Translation, Arabic Text Vocalization, Arabic Text recognition, OCR, Arabic Speech Synthesis and Recognition, Evaluation of Arabic Software, Software Development, E-learning and Instructional Technologies.
