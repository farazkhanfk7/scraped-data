# Dr. Mohammad Hussein Hammoudeh

Prof Hammoudeh is the Saudi Aramco Chair Professor of Cyber Security in the Information & Computer Science Department at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM). Mohammad is the founder and co-Editor in Chief of ACM's journal of Distributed Ledger Technology: Research & Practice.
Prior to joining KFUPM, Mohammad was the head of the CfACS IoT and Cyber Security Lab he founded in 2016 at the Manchester Metropolitan University. To date, Mohammad has been awarded above £12.6M in competitive research funding as Principal/Co-Investigator for 19 research projects. Working with a global collaborative research network spanning the academic community, industry, policymakers and wider technology stakeholders, he published over 90 refereed conference papers, and over 90 peer-reviewed journal articles, and is a successful editor of 4 books and many journals special issues. In 2019, he was selected for the Good to Great Future RKE Leaders programme at Manchester Met. He was awarded the Outstanding Innovation in Learning and Teaching Award in 2016.
Mohammad advised the UK’s Government on law reform related to national cybersecurity through a number of committees and hearings. He co-developed a state-of-the-art unprivileged and trustless computing zero-trust security theory. This theory of zero trust is rooted in his research on smart cities and critical infrastructures such as smart grids. Throughout his 15 years research career, Mohammad developed significant insight and expertise in a number of computer science disciplines (such as Artificial Intelligence) adjacent to his area of specialism (distributed systems). To this end, he continues to build his reputation internationally as a competent academic, demonstrated by more than 45 plenary talks and seminars at international conferences and events. His research interest includes applications of zero trust security to Internet-connected critical national infrastructures, blockchains, the Internet of Things/Cyber-Physical Systems, and other complex highly decentralized systems.
